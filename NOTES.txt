From README

Note that there will be no configure file if you obtain the djvulibre 
source using git clone. Instead there is a script 'autogen.sh' that 
uses automake to generate and call the actual configure script.
Since all autogen.sh arguments will be passed to configure,
you can simply treat autogen.sh as a replacement for configure.

...

You can then perform the compilation by typing 

        $ make

JSB                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose uniq new project name and specify the path to the folder with djvulibre's Makefile.

JSB: 

Accept autodetected source files that will be included in the project.
